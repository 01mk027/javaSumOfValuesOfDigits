## Introduction and purpose
This software is developed for Java101 course on <a href="https://patika.dev">patika.dev</a>. Aim of this software is finding values of each digit of a number which is entered by user via keyboard and sum obtained values.<br/>

## So short theoretical information
Assume that, user entered the number of 1257. Software is responsible the find the result of the formula which is written in below:<br/>
    1 + 2 + 5 + 7
As seen in above its <b>very</b> basic.

## Processes
Software consists of two phases. Each phase includes a while loop. In first phase, number of digits must be found. Technically, number of digits of any number equals to how many times relevant number can be divided to 10.
Second phase also includes a while loop for getting values of digits and sum all of them.
